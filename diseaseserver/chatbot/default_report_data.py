 4.3-6.5 good control
 6.6-7.5 satisfactory control
>7.5 unsatisfactory control
Our HbA1c method is performed according to the IFCC standard.
Please note, that the IFCC Standards are more sensitive and are able to
recognize a pathologic Glucose tolerance at the earliest.
No sign of diabetic glucose metabolism (glycosylation).
Decreased HbA1c levels are observed in hemolytic anemia.
